###Installing Ruby on Rails on CentOS 7, using rbenv**********************
#Install rbenv, which we will use to install and manage our Ruby installation. Install the rbenv and Ruby dependencies with yum
$sudo yum install -y git-core zlib zlib-devel gcc-c++ patch readline readline-devel libyaml-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel make bzip2 autoconf automake libtool bison curl sqlite-devel
#Now we are ready to install rbenv. The easiest way to do that is to run these commands, as the user that will be using Ruby
$cd
$git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv
$echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$exec $SHELL
$git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
$echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$exec $SHELL    #This installs rbenv into your home directory, and sets the appropriate environment variables that will allow rbenv to the active version of Ruby
#Now we're ready to install Ruby. Before using rbenv, determine which version of Ruby that you want to install. We will install the latest version, Ruby 2.2.1
#As the user that will be using Ruby, install it with these commands
$rbenv install -v 2.2.1
$rbenv global 2.2.1
#The global sub-command sets the default version of Ruby that all of your shells will use. If you want to install and use a different version, simply run the rbenv commands with a different version number
#Verify that Ruby was installed properly with this command
$ruby -v
#It is likely that you will not want Rubygems to generate local documentation for each gem that you install, as this process can be lengthy. To disable this, run this command
$echo "gem: --no-document" > ~/.gemrc
#You will also want to install the bundler gem, to manage your application dependencies
$gem install bundler
#As the same user, install Rails 4.2.0 with this command
$gem install rails -v 4.2.0
#Whenever you install a new version of Ruby or a gem that provides commands, you should run the rehash sub-command. This will install shims for all Ruby executables known to rbenv, which will allow you to use the executables
$rbenv rehash
#Verify that Rails has been installed properly by printing its version, with this command
$rails -v 
#A few Rails features, such as the Asset Pipeline, depend on a Javascript runtime. We will install Node.js to provide this functionality.
#Add the EPEL yum repository
$sudo yum -y install epel-release
#Then install the Node.js package
$sudo yum install nodejs
###Note: This will probably not install the latest release of Node.js, as Enterprise Linux does not consider it to be "stable". If you want to install the latest version, feel free to build it on your own
###Congratulations! Ruby on Rails is now installed on your system
###Testing the Ruby on Rails Installation 
#If you want to make sure that your Ruby on Rails installation went smoothly, you can quickly create a test application to test it out. For simplicity, our test application will use sqlite3 for its database
$cd ~
$rails new testapp
#Then move into the application's directory
$cd testapp
#Create the sqlite3 database
$rake db:create
#If you don't already know the public IP address of your server, look it up with this command
$ip addr show enp0s3 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2; }' | sed 's/\/.*$//'
#Copy the IPv4 address to your clipboard, then use it with this command to start your Rails application: (substitute the highlighted part with the IP address)
$rails server --binding=<server_public_IP>
###If it is working properly, your Rails application should be running on port 3000 of the public IP address of your server. Visit your Rails application by going there in a web browser
###http://server_public_IP:3000
*******************You're now ready to start developing your new Ruby on Rails application. Good luck!****************************************************************************************

*****************************Ruby Programming Language*****************************************
#A variable does not point to a variable. A variable points to the assignment of a variable
####String interpolation doesnt work with single quote 
name = "Rumman Ahmed"
"My name is #{name}"  #Prints out the value of the variable name 
###You cannot use signle quote within a single quote. To use single quote inside a string surround it with double quote or you can use the escape character \ to preceede the single quote 
###the stringvar.length method counts the space as a character 

To start irb console:  irb

***************Working with Strings**************************************************************************
String concat structure:  String1 + String2 || String1 + " " + String2 + String3

To find out what class the object belongs to:  Variable_name.class  ||  1.class

To find out methods available to an object:  objectname.methods

Some methods that can be used on objects:  objectname.nil?, objectname.empty?, objectname.length, objectname.reverse

String interpolation (remember has to be within double quotes):  name = "Mashrur" ==> "My name is #{name}"  ##This will print out the value of name in the line "My name is...."

To escape the evaluation of #{variablename} within a String, prepent with a \:  \#{variablename}

To get input from the command line use the following method:  gets.chomp

To assign the input to a variable so it can be referenced later on:  variablename = gets.chomp

******************Working with Numbers******************************************************************************
puts 1 + 2  #To add and display the value of 1 + 2
#Different operations
1 + 2  #Addition
1 * 2  #Multiplication
1 / 2  #Division
1 - 2  #Subtraction
1 % 2  #Modulus (gives the remainder when two numbers are divided)
20 is an integer, 20.0 is a float  #To indicate a number is a float instead of an integer include a . in the number or 20.to_f 
#Methods you can use to find odd and even number:
object.odd?
22.odd?
object.even?
22.even?
#odd number has a remainder of 1 and even number has a remainder of 0 
#Comparisons:
a == b
1 == 2
3 == 3
5 < 2
2 <= 5
5 > 2
5 && 6
5 || 6
#Generate a random number between 0 and less than 10
rand(10)  #Does not include 10 prints out a random number from 0-9
objectname.to_i or "5".to_i  #To convert an string object to integer
objectname.to_s or 5.to_s  #To convert an object to string



*************************************Methods and Branching*************************************************
def multiply(first_number, second_number)
  first_number.to_f * second_number.to_f
end

def divide(first_number, second_number)
  first_number.to_f / second_number.to_f
end

def subtract(first_number, second_number)
  second_number.to_f - first_number.to_f
end

def mod(first_number, second_number) 
  first_number.to_f % second_number.to_f
end

puts "What would you like to do 1)Multiply, 2)Divide, 3)Subtract, 4)Mod"
prompt = gets.chomp 

puts "Please enter First Number"
first_number = gets.chomp
puts "PLease enter Second Number"
second_number = gets.chomp

************************************************Arrays and Iterators**************************************************************************
#An Array is an ordered list of objects and elements. It maintains an index for each item so you can access those elements 
#An Array 
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "Rumman", [1, 2, 3]]
#Since Arrays have an index associated with each object they are very easy to grab item from the Array to display them 
a[1]
puts a
a.empty?
a.include?("Rumman")
a.reverse
a.reverse!   #mutates the caller
a.shuffle
(0..25).to_a  #takes a range of 0 to 25 and creates an array
y = (0..99).to_a.shuffle!  #takes a range of 0 to 99 creates an array and shuffle the numbers inside the array
z = (0..10).to_a
z
z << 25  #adds an element to an array
z.push(30) #Another way of adding an object to an array 
z.unshift("Rumman")  #Adds an element to the begining of the array 
z[0]
z.pop   #deletes an object from the end of an array 
z.uniq  #hides duplicate elements in an array 
z.uniq! #mutates the caller the duplicates are gone
y.each {|i| puts i}  #to iterate through an array use the .each method. It loops through an array 
#Using the for loop to iterate through an array 
for number in y
puts "Hi"
end 

#Creating an array of strings
names = ["joe", "john", "james"]
#To iterate over the array and print the names with a hello salutation
names.each do |food|
puts "Hello #{food}"
end 

names.each do |food|
puts "Hello #{food.capitalize}"
end 

names.each { |food| puts "Hello #{food.capitalize}" }   #one liner 

y.select { |number| number.odd? }  #The select method takes a boolean expression to evaluate and if that boolean expression evaluates to true its basically gets the number 
y.each { |number| print number if number.odd? }  #another way of iterating the array and printing out the odd numbers 

p = ["My", "name", "is", "Rumman"]
p.join
p.join(' ') 

#######
#Array, created by including elements within square brackets:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

#The index for an array starts with 0, so in the array above a[0] is 1

#Some methods you can use on arrays:

arrayname.empty?

arrayname.include?(itemname)

arrayname.reverse

arrayname.reverse! # use ! at the end to change the original array

arrayname.shuffle

arrayname.push(30) # will append new element 30 to the end array

arrayname << 25 # << known as shovel operator will also append new element to the end of the array

arrayname.unshift("someelement") # will add element "some element" to the beginning of the array

arrayname.pop # will remove the last element of the array and return 1

arrayname.uniq # will remove all the duplicates and display (will not change the original array)

arrayname.uniq! # will remove all the duplicates in the original array

#A range:

(0..25).to_a

#will create an array with elements from value 0 to 25

(0..99).to_a.shuffle!

#will create an array with elements from value 0 to 99 in random order

#To loop through an array named y using the .each method and print out the value of each element:

y.each { |i| puts i }

#In plain terms: For each element i in array y print the value of i

To execute iteration through an array called names using a block:

names.each do |randomvariablename| # starts the do block

puts "Hello #{randomvariablename}" # executes code for each element

end # ends the do block

#To capitalize (or use another method) on each element of array called names:

names.each { |randomvariablename| puts "Hello #{randomvariablename.capitalize}" }

#Using the select method to pickup all the odd numbers from an array y:

y.select { |number| number.odd? } # selects the value and returns it only if the condition is met

#To join the elements of an array named p:

p.join

#To join the elements of an array with space in between each element:

p.join(" ")

To join the elements of an array with dash in between each element:

p.join("-")


*************************************************************HASHES************************************************************************************************************
#Like Array a hash is a data structure that stores values but unlike array a hash also has keys associated with those values. Hash exist in a key value pair
#The key is usually a symbol but it can be other things as well like a string and the values can be any data type
#Creating a hash with key as strings
my_details = {'name' => 'rumman', 'favcolor' => 'green'}
my_details["favcolor"]  #To call a hash refer to the key 
#creating a hash with key as symbols
myhash = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4} 
myhash[:c]  #to call the value refer to the symbol 
myhash[:e] = 7  #to add value to the hash 
myhash[:name] = "Rumman"
myhash.delete(:b)  #to delete a value from hash 

#To create a hash
number = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: 5, f: 6, g: 7, h: 8, i: 9}
#To iterate through a hash
number.each { |k, v| puts "The key is #{k}, and the value is #{v}" }
#To iterate through a hash and delete multiple values 
number.each { |k, v| number.delete(k) if v > 3 }
#To slect the odd number in the hash
number = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 5, e: 9}
number.select { |k, v| v.odd? }

######
To create a hash called my_details include the elements within { }:

my_details = {'name' => 'mashrur', 'favcolor' => 'red'}

To access the value and notify me what favcolor is:

my_details["favcolor"]

Alternate syntax to create key, value pairs in hash:

myhash = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}

To access the value for key c above:

myhash[:c]

To add a key,value pair to the hash above:

myhash[:d] = 7

myhash[:name] = "Mashrur"

To delete a key,value pair simply delete the key:

myhash.delete(:d)

To iterate through a hash using .each method and print out value:

myhash.each { |somekey, somevalue| puts somevalue }

To iterate through a hash using .each method and print out both key and value in friendly format:

myhash.each { |somekey, somevalue| puts "The key is #{somekey} and the value is #{somevalue}" }

To iterate through and delete a items from a hash based on a condition (in the condition below if the value is greater than 3:

myhash.each { |k, v| myhash.delete(k) if v > 3 }

Use select method to display items only if value of the item is odd

myhash.select { |k, v| v.odd? }
